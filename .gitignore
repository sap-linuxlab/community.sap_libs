# .gitignore defines files to ignore and remain untracked in Git
# Each line in a gitignore file specifies a pattern, eg. directory or file extension

# Git should not track binary artifacts such as images, libraries, executables, archive files etc.
# Until the team has mature processes, a Binary Artifacts Repository Manager is not in use.

# Therefore some binary artifacts are tracked in this Git repository


# Further .gitignore templates available at:
# https://github.com/github/gitignore

#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
